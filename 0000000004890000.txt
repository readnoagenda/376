ac; And this Kinde Durkee, interestingly enough, on just a couple weeks ago, a federal judge granted the request of Assistant U.S. District Attorney, John K. Vincent to delay a preliminary hearing that has been scheduled.
And it will now be held on January 26th. So this woman hasn't even had her preliminary done yet.
And she embezzled five million dollars of Senator Feinstein's campaign.
So that's fishy, to say the least. Right?
