In fact I do have a clip. I've got the Ron Paul of Fox. Where he's with Neil Cavulo and he's starting to bitch about something or about the media and Cavulo's looking left (you can't see it on this clip, obviously) but Cavulo's looking left and looking right and they're yelling in his ear and he cuts to commercial and that's the end of Ron Paul.

crp; Thank you, Neil. Good to be with you.
cnc; How important is this state for you?
crp; Well,
