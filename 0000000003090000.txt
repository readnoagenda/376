get money from advertising from all the search sites, right? So if you searched for, let's say, The Artist, you wouldn't find a search result anywhere which pointed directly to any of the megaupload.com sites. But if you were an affiliate 9because they had a very sophisticated affiliate model in place)you would get their links and they ran the ads on the sites. That is obviously racketeering. There's no way around it if that is all true. They claim to be hiding behind the DMCA regulation but they had a tool that they would let.
