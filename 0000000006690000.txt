jd;Some Salafits has gotta explain, or somebody who's not a Salafits, but one of the other guys, has to explain where this comes from, because I don't know... you can't cut your beard. Is that... I didn't know that was in the Quran, but apparently it must be, or it's somewhere.
ac;It's interesting how, isn't that the same with Orthodox Jews, they also can't cut their beard, and...
jd;Yeah, no, they're very much cut from the same cloth.
ac;Huh. On opposite sides of the cloth, though.
jd;Well, one wears black, all black, and the other one wears all white, so I guess maybe.
