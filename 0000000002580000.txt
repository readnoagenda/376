He says "No. My taxes are on my computer so I don't know what it was." However he then stumbles later and says "Oh it was a very unhappy check I had to write."

jd; Oh really? I missed that!
ac; You didn't catch that?  Oh yeah .. yeah he says.. first it's like "on my computer at home. So when I get home ... ... there's no one there... "
Hey ever hear of Go To PC? Idiot!
jd; [laughs]
ac; They're like [in a retarded voice] "I cannot get to my PC right now. It's on my computer."
