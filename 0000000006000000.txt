Now I don't want anyone taking pictures of my tie, because they're going to quote-unquote "buy" the tie.
"Hey, the tie has been out of service for ten years. I wear old ties."
How many ties can you buy?
I mean, who's gonna take a picture of someone's tie, because you want to buy the tie?
It's usually a red tie, I mean, you don't need to take a picture.
Or can't you pick a tie?
Can't you go to the store, like a normal person...
