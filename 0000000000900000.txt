jd;what that's all about.
ac;well, i think...
jd;i can tell you this.
the one thing that's come out of this is that this whole thing is rigged for one reason and one reason only, and i have a bunch of clips that kinda take us down this road
ac;alright
jd;this whole thing is scripted, and the whole idea came to me from reverend manning
ac;-chuckle-
jd;who had... i don't have his clip, because unfortunately i've been looking at... it's a long story why i don't have it, but i'll just tell you in a nutshell what he said.
and as soon as he said this i said, "yeah it makes nothing but sense"
