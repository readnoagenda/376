ac; and the airport by the way.  You walk off the plane you know everything is outside its completely open and then you still have to wait 2 hours to get your frickin bags because 2 continental flights arrived at the same time.  
One from Houston and one from Newark and the same guys that offload the bags have to onload the bags to get...and do the check in to get the passengers out again.  
So it was horrible, you know, it was very hard to get any research done and everything is very slow so... but I did follow up on a lot of that so we've got a lot to talk about.
