ac; good this stuff
jd; It stinks, it's boring, who are these women -- that's what I always think.  Who are these women and how come there are so many of them?
ac; And how come they're not hanging out here?
jd; I never see any of these women.
ac; Oh man.  Anyway, so that's my take on it and I'm really sticking to it and we keep watching and keep evaluating stuff and you'll see bit by bit things come out.  But I'm calling these guys -- each one of them -- shills.  Including this Kim Dotcom guy.
