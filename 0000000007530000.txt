jd;Oh, Boner? I thought it was Boner.
ac;Yeah, Boner. Gitmo Nation Boner.
jd;So you're in Boner.
ac;Yep.
jd;And then after Thursday, when are you coming back?
ac;We're flying back Saturday morning.
jd;Oh, okay.
ac;So the plane that flies in Saturday morning, and by the way, it'll be a two-hour wait at this crummy airport just to get on board, I know how it happened last time.
