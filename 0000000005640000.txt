"Dear John and Adam, I'm taking the opportunity to show you guys the sincerest form of love, short of giving you my life."
ac; -laughter-
jd; "By giving you some of my money in exchange for the value you deliver each week. Thank you for working on shedding light on the truth. Which is the most noble human endeavour. I consider myself among the enlightened so I'm doing my part to make sure other can hear. I give financially to my church for the same reason and I think that it makes just as much sense to give it to you guys."
Double nickels on the dime from Rory.
ac; Very nice. Thank you, Rory, thank you very much.
