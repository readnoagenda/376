Russia now in talks with the US and Europe on plans to create a manned research base on the moon!
There you go.
Moon bases! Confirmed! Once again!
Hate to say it.

ac;You can cross it off the red book.
I've always said there were moon bases up there, and now they're just going say, "Oh, yeah, no, yeah, we were planning, yeah, we'll do a moon base."
Bullcrap, there's plenty of moon bases already.
They're just trying to trick us.

ac;Alright.
