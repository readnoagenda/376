ac; And the airport by the way, you walk off the plane you know everything is outside its completely open.
And then you still have to wait 2 hours to get your fricking bags because 2 continental flights arrived at the same time.  
One from Houston and one from Newark. 
And the same guys that offload the bags have to on-load the bags to get - and do the check-in to get the passengers out again.  
So it was horrible, you know, it was very hard to get any research done.
And everything is very slow so - but I did follow up on a lot of that, so we've got a lot to talk about.
