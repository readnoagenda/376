jd: She the one who deep-fat fries butter.
ac; Right. Well guess what she's doing now?
She's now doing a diabetes treatment commercial for Novo Nordisk's diabetes treatment, Victoza.
A whole promotion! First, she comes out and 'I have diabetes, and, you know, I'm living with type 2 diabetes.'
A literally she comes out after that with a commercial for diabetes medicine!
dj; Kind of tight timing, isn't it?
