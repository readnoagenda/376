Bonaire is only a four hour flight.
So instead of flying from Austin to Houston, and Houston down to Bonaire, we'd drive up.
Which I thought, you know, it's like three hours, if you put it all together, flying is more hours.
jd;You drove to Houston?
ac;Yeah.
jd;You drove to Houston??
ac;Yes!
jd;Wow.
ac;Well it's only three hours.
It was fun, you know.
It was a midnight flight, so I was like, "Ah, we'll just drive", you know, whatever.
It was actually quite nice.
