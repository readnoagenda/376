c; Remember all those stories about campaign finance for Obama coming from foreign countries, and there were bundlers who were apparently Americans living overseas?
And they were, of course, only taking money from Americans? But it was all really cagey? It was like three-four hundred million dollars? Remember those stories, John?
jd; Yeah. Oh yeah. We talked about the possibly that all these single donations are actually big chunks of dough.
It was an elaborate scheme to like take a bunch of huge donations then spread out them over- nickel and dime them and then bring it in through the internet
and it was not traceable at that point.
