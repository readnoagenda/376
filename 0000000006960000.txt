jd;All the internets are going to be firewalled off from each other.
ac;Yeah.
jd;There won't be an Internet anymore, and no-one's going to care.
I've said this, I've said it before, and I'll say it again: We'll have a national internet in the United States, and Iran will have one, everyone will have one, and it'll be walled off, excepting if you're an academic or if you know what you're doing, sure you can get to the Chinese websites if you want to, but generally speaking, the average American, if you walled off the internet tomorrow, so you could not really get out of the country, people could still get to Amazon...
ac;Oh, yeah.
jd;...they could still read the New York Times, they could still look at YouTube videos of cats.
ac;And Facebook!
