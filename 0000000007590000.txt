ac; So ..uh.. everybody? Thank you very much for hanging in there! John? Thank you.. I know that.. I know that it is difficult from my end and I know it is even harder on your end because you probably are not only hearing every other word I say but probably only half the clips I play, right?
jd; Ahh .. It could be better!
ac; Yeah. Anyway.. we try! But this is the cheapest vacation I could get cause I am not paying for where I am staying. And that's my motto damn it! Coming to you ...
jd; Yeah! Hey I am ALL FOR IT!
ac; [laughs] Coming to you from Gitmo
