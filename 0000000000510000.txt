c;the long time penn state coach injured his pelvis and right shoulder in august of 2011, after getting blindsided accidentally by a receiver during pre-season practice
just weeks before he turned 85, it was announced paterno was being treated for lung cancer
he would also break his pelvis again in a fall at home
ac;so very interesting when i heard the summary of what has happened to this guy ever since this scandal came out
but of course, this is all revolving around the pedobear foundation "two mile", run by sandusky, and it seems pretty clear to me, john, that the guy got a couple warnings, you know, it's like, you know, like the mob usually does, they'll break your pelvis, throw you down the stairs
