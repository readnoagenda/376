jc;was that romney was gonna be the final choice, but he... and he was going to win new hampshire, but then perry was gonna come in and he was gonna win south carolina
everybody talked about that before any of these elections
and then iowa was up for grabs
ac;right
jd;and so it's worked out perfectly
and then perry comes along and steps in... he's essentially a loser. he can't be a candidate.
and so he just had to quit, and so they still needed somebody to follow the script and win south carolina besides romney
