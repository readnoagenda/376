jd;huh
so has anyone paid for it?
ac;no, of course not, no one's gonna do that
they use their septic tanks, you know, they poop in the ocean, and why would anyone pay for a fiber connection, when you've got this great connection already?
jd;-chuckle-
well if i was there, i'd hook to that fiber, it'd be all me
ac;yeah
